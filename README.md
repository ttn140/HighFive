Describe what the app you are trying to build ? detailing the main use cases for this app.
    
    We are trying to build an app that allows users to exchange general information to prospective employers, prospective recruits, or to build a network. It essentially will act similarly to a virtual business card and/or resume that will let you provide contact information in order to allow the users to communicate again in the future.

Describe the features that will be included in this app.
    
    Tap to pass feature - This will leverage NFC technology that will essentially allow you to “hand out” a user’s business card. Alternatively, the user can use a QR code.
    Profile feature - This will be the user’s profile. The user can add or update contact information on themselves such as name, phone number, company, email, LinkedIn link, and profile photo
    Rolodex feature - This will be a way for the users of the app to sort and maintain the list of contacts they have met. This will be where a user can view another user’s profile and keep notes on them.
